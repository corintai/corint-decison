# CORINT Risk Definition Language (RDL)
## Feature Engineering and Statistical Analysis Specification (v0.1)

Feature engineering is the foundation of risk control decision-making. This document defines the statistical analysis, feature computation, and aggregation query capabilities in CORINT.

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Feature Engineering in Risk Management

In risk control scenarios, extensive statistical analysis computations are needed to identify risk patterns:

- **Behavioral Features**: Login count in the past 7 days, transaction frequency, etc.
- **Association Features**: Number of device IDs associated with the same IP address, number of accounts associated with the same device
- **Temporal Features**: Time since last transaction, average transaction interval, etc.
- **Aggregation Features**: Average transaction amount in the past 30 days, maximum single transaction, etc.

### 1.2 Feature Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `behavioral` | User behavior patterns | Login frequency, transaction velocity |
| `association` | Entity relationships | IP-to-device mapping, device-to-user mapping |
| `temporal` | Time-based features | Time since last action, hour of day |
| `statistical` | Aggregated statistics | Average, median, percentile |
| `derived` | Computed from other features | Velocity ratio, deviation score |

---

## 2. Statistical Aggregation Functions

### 2.1 Basic Aggregations

Extends the basic aggregation functions from `expression.md`:

```yaml
# Count
- count(user.logins, last_7d) > 100
- count(user.transactions, last_24h) >= 5

# Sum
- sum(transaction.amounts, last_7d) > 50000
- sum(withdrawal.amounts, last_month) > user.monthly_limit

# Average
- avg(transaction.amount, last_30d) < 100
- avg(login.session_duration, last_week) > 3600

# Min/Max
- max(transaction.amount, last_month) > 100000
- min(account.balance, last_quarter) < 0

# Median
- median(transaction.amount, last_30d) > 1000

# Standard Deviation
- stddev(transaction.amount, last_30d) > 5000
```

### 2.2 Distinct Count (Unique Value Counting)

**Core Capability**: Count unique values - the most commonly used method for association analysis in risk control.

```yaml
# Distinct count - unique value counting
# Syntax: count_distinct(field, filters, time_window)

# How many device IDs are associated with the same IP address in the past 5 hours
- count_distinct(
    field: device.id,
    where: {geo.ip == event.geo.ip},
    window: last_5h
  ) > 10

# How many users are associated with the same device in the past 24 hours
- count_distinct(
    field: user.id,
    where: {device.id == event.device.id},
    window: last_24h
  ) > 5

# How many different IP addresses has this user logged in from in the past 7 days
- count_distinct(
    field: geo.ip,
    where: {user.id == event.user.id},
    window: last_7d
  ) > 20

# How many different devices has this user used in the past 1 hour
- count_distinct(
    field: device.id,
    where: {user.id == event.user.id},
    window: last_1h
  ) >= 3
```

### 2.3 Percentile

```yaml
# Percentile calculation
# Useful for detecting outliers

# Is the current transaction amount above the user's 95th percentile for the past 30 days
- event.transaction.amount > percentile(
    transaction.amount,
    where: {user.id == event.user.id},
    window: last_30d,
    p: 95
  )

# Is the current login duration below the 10th percentile (abnormally fast)
- event.login.duration < percentile(
    login.duration,
    where: {user.id == event.user.id},
    window: last_90d,
    p: 10
  )
```

## 3. Feature Definition

### 3.1 Defining Features in Pipeline

Define reusable features in the Pipeline:

```yaml
pipeline:
  # Feature extraction step
  - type: extract
    id: user_behavior_features
    
    # Define features
    features:
      # Simple field extraction
      - name: user_tier
        value: event.user.profile.tier
        
      # Time-based aggregation
      - name: login_count_7d
        value: count(user.logins, last_7d)
        
      # Distinct count
      - name: ip_count_7d
        value: count_distinct(
            field: geo.ip,
            where: {user.id == event.user.id},
            window: last_7d
          )
          
      # Statistical aggregation
      - name: avg_transaction_30d
        value: avg(transaction.amount, last_30d)
        
      # Derived feature
      - name: transaction_velocity
        value: count(transactions, last_24h) / count(transactions, last_7d)
        
      # Complex condition
      - name: is_high_risk_pattern
        value: |
          count_distinct(device.id, {user.id == event.user.id}, last_24h) > 3 &&
          count_distinct(geo.ip, {user.id == event.user.id}, last_24h) > 5
    
    # Output to context
    output: context.user_features
```

        - name: avg_session_duration_30d
          value: avg(session.duration, last_30d)
    
    # Association features

## 13. Integration with Rules

### 13.1 Using Features in Rules

```yaml
rule:
  id: high_ip_device_association
  name: High IP-Device Association Risk
  description: Detect IP addresses associated with too many devices
  
  when:
    event.type: login
    conditions:
      # Use pre-computed features
      - context.risk_features.devices_per_ip_5h > 10
      - context.risk_features.users_per_ip_5h > 5
      
  score: 80

---

rule:
  id: abnormal_user_velocity
  name: Abnormal User Velocity Pattern
  description: Detect unusual user activity velocity
  
  when:
    event.type: transaction
    conditions:
      - context.risk_features.login_velocity_change > 5
      - context.risk_features.transaction_count_24h > context.risk_features.avg_transaction_30d * 3
      
  score: 70
```

## 14. Best Practices

### 14.1 Feature Design Principles

✅ **Good:**
```yaml
# Clear naming
- name: devices_per_ip_5h
  value: count_distinct(device.id, {geo.ip == event.geo.ip}, last_5h)

# With description and threshold
- name: users_per_device_24h
  description: Number of users associated with the same device (past 24 hours)
  value: count_distinct(user.id, {device.id == event.device.id}, last_24h)
  risk_threshold: 3
  risk_level: high
```

❌ **Bad:**
```yaml
# Unclear naming
- name: metric1
  value: count_distinct(device.id, {geo.ip == event.geo.ip}, last_5h)

# No documentation
- name: x
  value: count_distinct(user.id, {device.id == event.device.id}, last_24h)
```

### 14.2 Performance Optimization

✅ **Good:** Group related features to minimize queries
```yaml
feature_groups:
  - group: ip_associations
    # Single query for all IP-related associations
    features:
      - devices_per_ip_5h
      - users_per_ip_5h
      - transactions_per_ip_5h
```

❌ **Bad:** Scattered individual queries
```yaml
features:
  - name: feature1
    value: count_distinct(device.id, {geo.ip == event.geo.ip}, last_5h)
  
  # ... other unrelated features ...
  
  - name: feature2
    value: count_distinct(user.id, {geo.ip == event.geo.ip}, last_5h)
```

### 14.3 Time Window Selection

Choose appropriate time windows based on business scenarios:

| Scenario | Recommended Window | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Real-time fraud detection | last_5m, last_1h | Fast response |
| Login risk | last_5h, last_24h | Balance performance and accuracy |
| Transaction risk | last_24h, last_7d | Capture short-term patterns |
| User profiling | last_30d, last_90d | Stable long-term features |
| Device association | last_5h, last_24h | IP/device changes quickly |

## 15. Summary

This document defines CORINT RDL's feature engineering and statistical analysis capabilities:

- **Statistical Aggregations** - count, sum, avg, min, max, median, stddev, percentile
- **Distinct Count** - Unique value counting for association analysis
- **Association Analysis** - Relationships between IP/Device/User entities
- **Temporal Features** - Time-related features and velocity features
- **Feature Groups** - Organize and manage related features
- **Performance Optimization** - Caching, batch queries, materialized views
- **Integration** - Integration with Rules and Pipelines

These capabilities enable CORINT to support complex risk control scenarios and meet real-time decision-making requirements.
