# CORINT Risk Definition Language (RDL)
## Overall Specification (v0.1)

**RDL is the domain-specific language used by CORINT (Cognitive Risk Intelligence) to define rules, rule groups, reasoning logic, and full risk‑processing pipelines.**  
It enables modern hybrid risk engines to combine deterministic logic with LLM‑based reasoning in a unified, explainable, high‑performance format.

---

## 1. Goals of RDL

RDL is designed to:

- Provide a declarative, human-readable format for risk logic  
- Support both traditional rule engines and LLM cognitive reasoning  
- Compile into a Rust‑friendly IR (AST) for high‑performance execution  
- Represent end‑to‑end risk processing flows  
- Enable transparency, auditability, and explainability  
- Be cloud‑native, language‑agnostic, and extensible  

---

## 2. Top-Level Components

An RDL file may contain one of the following:

```yaml
version: "0.1"

rule: {...}
# OR
ruleset: {...}
# OR
pipeline: [...]
```

Components:

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **rule** | A single risk logic unit |
| **ruleset** | A group of rules |
| **pipeline** | The full risk processing DAG |

---

## 3. Component Specification

### 3.1 Rule

A Rule is the smallest executable logic unit.

```yaml
rule:
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  when: <condition-block>
  score: number
  action: approve | deny | review | infer | <custom>
```

---

### 3.1.1 `when` Block

#### Event Filter

```yaml
when:
  event.type: login
```

#### Conditions

```yaml
conditions:
  - user.age > 60
  - geo.country in ["RU", "NG"]
```

Operators:

- `==`, `!=`
- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- `in`
- `regex`
- `exists`, `missing`

---

### 3.1.2 LLM-Based Conditions

```yaml
- LLM.reason(event) contains "suspicious"
- LLM.tags contains "device_mismatch"
- LLM.score > 0.7
- LLM.output.risk_score > 0.3
```

---

### 3.1.3 External API Conditions

```yaml
- external_api.Chainalysis.risk_score > 80
```

---

### 3.1.4 Decision Making

**Actions are not defined in Rules.**  
Rules only detect risk factors and provide scores.

Actions are defined in Ruleset's `decision_logic`:

```yaml
ruleset:
  id: fraud_detection
  rules:
    - rule_1  # Just scores
    - rule_2  # Just scores
    
  decision_logic:
    - condition: total_score >= 100
      action: deny  # Actions defined here
      
    - condition: total_score >= 50
      action: infer
      infer:
        data_snapshot: [event.*, context.*]
        
    - default: true
      action: approve
```

**Built-in Actions:**
- `approve` - Automatically approve  
- `deny` - Automatically reject
- `review` - Send to human review
- `infer` - Send to AI analysis (async)  

---

## 3.2 Ruleset

```yaml
ruleset:
  id: string
  name: string
  rules:
    - rule_id_1
    - rule_id_2
    - rule_id_3
  decision_logic:
    - condition: <expression>
      action: <action-type>
    - default: true
      action: <action-type>
```

Rulesets group rules and define decision logic based on rule combinations.

---

## 3.3 Pipeline

A pipeline defines the entire risk‑processing DAG.  
It supports:

- Sequential steps  
- Conditional steps  
- Branching  
- Parallel execution  
- Merge strategies  
- Score aggregation  
- Ruleset inclusion  
- External API calls  

(See `pipeline.md` for full details.)

---

## 4. Expression Language

RDL provides a powerful expression language for defining conditions and computations.

Key features:
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Comparison and membership operators
- String operations and regex
- Time-based aggregations
- Built-in functions
- LLM and external API integration

(See `expression.md` for complete specification.)

---

## 4.5 Feature Engineering and Statistical Analysis

RDL includes comprehensive feature engineering capabilities for risk control scenarios.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Distinct Count** - Unique value counting for association analysis
  ```yaml
  count_distinct(device.id, {geo.ip == event.geo.ip}, last_5h) > 10
  ```

- **Association Analysis** - Entity relationship metrics
  - IP → Device/User associations
  - Device → User associations
  - Identity reuse detection

- **Statistical Functions** - Advanced statistics
  - Percentiles, median, standard deviation
  - Z-score and outlier detection
  - Moving averages and rolling windows

- **Velocity Features** - Rate of change detection
  ```yaml
  login_velocity_ratio: (count(logins, last_24h) / count(logins, last_7d)) * 7
  ```

- **Temporal Features** - Time-based patterns
  - Time since last event
  - Off-hours detection
  - Impossible travel detection

**Common Use Cases:**
- Login count for an account in the past 7 days
- Number of device IDs associated with the same IP in the past 5 hours
- Number of users associated with the same device
- Whether transaction amount is an outlier (above 95th percentile)
- Whether user behavior speed has suddenly increased

(See `feature.md` for complete specification and examples.)

---

## 5. Data Types and Schema

RDL includes a comprehensive type system for data validation and safety.

Features:
- Primitive types (string, number, boolean, datetime)
- Composite types (arrays, objects, maps)
- Custom type definitions
- Schema validation
- Format validators

(See `schema.md` for full specification.)

---

## 6. Context and Variable Management

Context management enables data flow between pipeline steps.

Context layers:
- **event** - Input event data (read-only)
- **vars** - Pipeline variables (read-only)
- **context** - Step outputs (read-write)
- **sys** - System variables (read-only)
- **env** - Environment configuration (read-only)

(See `context.md` for complete details.)

---

## 7. LLM Integration

RDL enables seamless integration with Large Language Models for cognitive reasoning.

Capabilities:
- Multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom)
- Prompt engineering and templating
- Structured output schemas
- Response caching and optimization
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Cost tracking

(See `llm.md` for comprehensive guide.)

---

## 8. Error Handling

Production-grade error handling ensures reliability and graceful degradation.

Strategies:
- **fail** - Stop execution on critical errors
- **skip** - Continue without failed step
- **fallback** - Use default values
- **retry** - Retry with exponential backoff
- **circuit breaker** - Protect external services

(See `error-handling.md` for full specification.)

---

## 9. Observability

Comprehensive observability for monitoring and debugging.

Features:
- Structured logging with sampling
- Metrics (counters, gauges, histograms)
- Distributed tracing
- Audit trails
- Alerting
- Performance profiling
- Explainability

(See `observability.md` for complete guide.)

---

## 10. Testing

Robust testing framework for validation and quality assurance.

Test types:
- Unit tests (individual rules)
- Integration tests (rulesets)
- Pipeline tests (end-to-end)
- Regression tests (historical cases)
- Performance tests (load and stress)

(See `test.md` for testing specification.)

---

## 11. Performance Optimization

High-performance execution for real-time decisioning.

Optimizations:
- Multi-level caching
- Parallelization
- Lazy loading
- Early termination
- Connection pooling
- LLM optimization
- Resource management

(See `performance.md` for optimization strategies.)

---

## 12. External API Integration

```yaml
external_api.<provider>.<field>
```

Example:

```yaml
external_api.Chainalysis.risk_score > 80
```

## 16. Decision Architecture

RDL uses a three-layer decision architecture:

### Layer 1: Rules (Detectors)
- Detect individual risk factors
- Produce scores
- **No actions defined**

### Layer 2: Rulesets (Decision Makers)
- Combine rule results
- Evaluate patterns and thresholds
- **Define actions through decision_logic**
- Produce final decisions

### Layer 3: Pipelines (Orchestrators)
- Orchestrate execution flow
- Manage data flow between steps
- **No decision logic** - uses ruleset decisions

**Decision Flow:**
```
Rules → Scores → Ruleset → Action → Pipeline Output
```

## 17. Compilation Model

RDL compiles into:

1. **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** - Intermediate representation
2. **Rust IR** - High-performance execution format
3. **Type-checked IR** - With schema validation
4. **Explainability trace** - For decision transparency
5. **Deterministic + LLM hybrid execution plan** - Optimized execution

The compilation process includes:
- Syntax validation
- Type checking
- Dependency resolution
- Optimization passes
- Error detection
