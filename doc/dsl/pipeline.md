# CORINT Risk Definition Language (RDL)
## Pipeline Specification (v0.1)

A **Pipeline** defines the full risk‑processing flow in CORINT’s Cognitive Risk Intelligence framework.  
It represents a declarative Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) composed of *steps*, *branches*, *parallel flows*, and *aggregation nodes*.

Pipelines orchestrate how events move through feature extraction, cognitive reasoning (LLM), rule execution, scoring, and final actions.

---

## 1. Pipeline Structure

A pipeline is a list of steps:

```yaml
pipeline:
  - <step>
  - <step>
  - <branch>
  - <parallel>
  - <aggregate>
  - <include>
```

Each element is one of the pipeline constructs described below.

---

## 2. Step Types

A **step** is the smallest processing unit in a pipeline.

```yaml
step:
  id: string
  type: extract | reason | rules | api | score | action | custom
  if: <optional-condition>
  params: <key-value-map>
```

### 2.1 `type` definitions

| type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `extract` | Feature extraction (device info, geo-IP, KYC profile, etc.) |
| `reason` | LLM cognitive reasoning step |
| `rules` | Execute a ruleset |
| `service` | Internal service call (database, cache, microservice, etc.) |
| `api` | External API lookup (Chainalysis, MaxMind, device fingerprint, etc.) |
| `score` | Score computation or normalization |
| `action` | Produces final decision outcome |
| `custom` | User‑defined function (Python/Rust/etc.) |

### 2.2 `if` conditional

Every step may include a conditional:

```yaml
if: "event.amount > 1000"
```

The step executes **only** if the condition evaluates to true.

---

## 3. Branching

A branch selects between multiple sub‑pipelines based on conditions.

```yaml
- branch:
    when:
      - condition: "event.type == 'login'"
        pipeline:
          - extract_login
          - login_rules

      - condition: "event.type == 'payment'"
        pipeline:
          - extract_payment
          - payment_rules
```

Branch rules:

- Conditions are evaluated **top‑to‑bottom**
- First matching condition executes its pipeline
- Branch pipelines may contain any valid pipeline structures

---

## 4. Parallel Execution

Run multiple steps or pipelines concurrently.

```yaml
- parallel:
    - device_fingerprint
    - ip_reputation
    - llm_reasoning
  merge:
    method: all
```

### 4.1 Merge Methods

| method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `all` | Wait for all parallel tasks |
| `any` | Return on first successful completion |
| `fastest` | Use first response (for redundant reasoning/rules) |
| `majority` | Wait until >50% of tasks complete |

---

## 5. Aggregation

Aggregates multiple outputs into a unified representation, typically scores.

```yaml
- aggregate:
    method: weighted
    weights:
      rules_engine: 0.5
      llm_reasoning: 0.3
      chainalysis: 0.2
```

### 5.1 Methods

- `sum` – sum of all values  
- `max` – maximum value  
- `weighted` – custom weighted formula  

---

## 6. Include (Reusable Modules)

Pipelines may import:

- A ruleset
- Another pipeline (sub‑pipeline)

### 6.1 Ruleset include

```yaml
- include:
    ruleset: login_risk_rules
```

### 6.2 Pipeline include

```yaml
- include:
    pipeline: common_feature_flow
```

---

            - include:
